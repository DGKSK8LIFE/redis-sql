# How to contribute to redisql

Thank you so much for contributing to redisql, I'm working hard to grow the lib in terms of its userbase, performance, and functionality so you are helping expedite ascension!  

## Getting Started

### Look at issues

Most of the feature requests/bugs are described in the repo's issues. Ignore any with the "*done*" label, this means the desired functionality/patch is implemented in the unstable branch and will be merge in the next major release. 

### Get Coding

1. Make a feature branch in your fork (use any name relevant to what you're implementing).
2. Once you've finished, open a pull request to the `unstable` branch.
3. I will review your pull request accordingly and if it is acceptable, I will approve then merge.
